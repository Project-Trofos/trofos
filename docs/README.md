# TROFOS User guide

This user guide is deployed using Github Pages with Jekyll. The guide will serve as a user guide and the source information to be parsed and broken down to populate the vector DB in the Retrieve Augmented Generation (RAG) copilot, so it needs to adhere to a style guide so the information can be easily parsed to be embedded

## Inserting into vector db

In /rag_script, run the `insert_user_guide_embeddings.py`. the script takes everything after toc as contents- it finds a title- then all other subsequent content is the attached to that title

Deployment to production of embedded data is currently manual- make a sql dump locally and manually insert in the VM. Future devs to optimise ðŸ˜‰

`pg_dump -U <user name eg postgres> -h localhost -p 5432 -d pgvector -t '"UserGuideEmbedding"' > dump.sql` in the pgvector container

`docker cp <container>:/dump.sql C:\Users\...` in local terminal
