# TROFOS User guide

This user guide is deployed using Github Pages with Jekyll. The guide will serve as a user guide and the source information to be parsed and broken down to populate the vector DB in the Retrieve Augmented Generation (RAG) copilot, so it needs to adhere to a style guide so the information can be easily parsed to be embedded

## Inserting into vector db

In /rag_script, run the `insert_user_guide_embeddings.py`. the script looks into /docs/pages/rag_parse_pages, takes everything after toc as contents- it finds a title- then all other subsequent content is the attached to that title

Deployment to production of embedded data is currently manual- run the script in the VM to insert directly into vectordb. Future devs to optimise ðŸ˜‰

In `/docs/rag_script`:

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. `python ./insert_user_guide_embeddings.py`
