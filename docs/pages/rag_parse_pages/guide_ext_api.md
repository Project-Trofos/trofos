## How to Generate an API Key

<!-- API: POST /api/api-key/generate -->

1. Navigate to the **‘API Keys’** option in the side menu.
2. Click the **‘Generate’** button to create a new API key.
   - The API key will only be displayed once, so make sure to copy and store it securely.
   - If the key is lost, you can regenerate a new one by repeating this process.
