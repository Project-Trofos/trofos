## Project

A **Project** organizes work and collaboration in the application. It involves users, sprints, backlogs, and epics, and can be associated with a course or independent.

## Project User Management

As a student, you can invite users by email. They will receive an email invite to join your project. Faculty members and admins can directly add users into projects and have permissions to remove users as well. You can track email invites sent in the project users page as well.
