## Getting Started with Agile in TROFOS

If you’re new to Agile project management, TROFOS is designed to help you learn and apply Agile principles through hands-on experience. This guide walks you through setting up your first Agile project in TROFOS, from creating a project to completing sprints and reflecting on your progress.

---

**Step 1: Create Your First Project**

1. **Navigate to the ‘Projects’ Tab**:
   - Click the **‘Projects’** tab in the sidebar.  
   - Click the **‘Create Project’** button.

2. **Enter Project Details**:
   - Provide a project name and a project key (used to prefix backlogs, e.g., `P1-1` for your first backlog).
   - If your project is part of a course, attach it to the relevant course.  
   - If it’s independent, leave it unattached.  

---

**Step 2: Sprint Planning**

Agile projects are broken into sprints—short, focused periods of work aimed at achieving specific goals.  

1. **Create a Sprint**:
   - Go to your project’s **‘Sprint’** tab.
   - Click the **‘New Sprint’** button.  
   - Fill in:
     - Sprint name.
     - Duration (e.g., 2 weeks or a custom period).
     - Start date.
     - Sprint goal (e.g., "Complete user authentication module").  

2. **Plan Your Work**:
   - Break down your project into smaller tasks called **backlogs**.  
   - Assign backlogs to your sprint:
     - Include details like **status** (e.g., To Do), **priority**, **assignee**, and **story points** (an effort estimate).  

---

**Step 3: Daily Standups**

Standups are short, daily team meetings to discuss:
- What’s done.
- What’s next.
- Any blockers.

1. **Schedule Standups**:
   - Go to the **‘Standup’** tab in your project.
   - Click the **‘Schedule Standup’** button and set a time for daily standups.  

2. **Participate in Standups**:
   - Use the **Standup Board** to share updates:
     - Mark backlogs as **Done**, **Next**, or **Blocker** using the gear icon on the **Scrum Board**.  
     - Alternatively, type updates manually in the **Standup Board**.  
   - Focus on collaboration and resolving blockers.

---

**Step 4: Managing Your Scrum Board**

The Scrum Board is your central tool for tracking sprint progress.  

1. **Organize Backlogs**:
   - View tasks under columns like **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**.  
   - Use drag-and-drop functionality to update statuses.  

2. **Track Updates**:
   - Keep your backlogs up to date as you work through the sprint.  

---

**Step 5: Completing a Sprint and Sprint Retrospective**

At the end of a sprint, review what was achieved and reflect on how to improve.

1. **Complete the Sprint**:
   - Click the **‘Complete Sprint’** button in the **‘Sprint’** tab.  
   - Move incomplete backlogs to the next sprint.  

2. **Sprint Retrospective**:
   - Access the **Retrospective** page for the sprint.  
   - Reflect with your team:
     - **What Went Well**: Celebrate successes.  
     - **What Could Be Done Better**: Identify improvement areas.  
     - **Actions for Next Sprint**: Plan actionable steps.  

---

**Step 6: Monitoring Progress**

1. **Use Dashboards**:
   - View the **Project Overview Dashboard** and charts like burndown charts and sprint velocity in the **‘Statistics’** tab.  
   - Monitor sprint progress and identify bottlenecks.

2. **Stay Agile**:
   - Continuously adapt based on retrospective insights and dashboard data.

By following these steps, you’ll gain hands-on experience in Agile practices, develop teamwork skills, and effectively manage your project using TROFOS.

## Best Practices for Agile in TROFOS

Adopting Agile practices effectively requires discipline, collaboration, and a focus on continuous improvement. Below are some best practices to help you and your team succeed in Agile while using TROFOS:

---

**1. Complete Story Points Consistently**

- **Avoid Last-Minute Rush**: Distribute workload evenly throughout the sprint instead of cramming tasks at the end.
- **Track Progress Daily**: Use the **burndown chart** and **daily completed story points chart** in TROFOS to monitor progress.
- **Break Down Large Tasks**: Divide complex backlogs into smaller, actionable tasks to make steady progress.

---

**2. Set Realistic Sprint Goals**

- **Align Capacity with Commitment**: Estimate story points realistically based on team capacity and past sprint velocity.
- **Plan for Unforeseen Issues**: Leave some buffer for unexpected blockers or delays during sprint planning.

---

**3. Use Standups Effectively**

- **Keep Updates Short and Relevant**: Share concise updates on what’s done, what’s next, and any blockers.
- **Focus on Collaboration**: Use the **Standup Board** to identify and address blockers quickly.

---

**4. Prioritize Communication**

- **Keep Everyone Aligned**: Regularly update the **Scrum Board** to reflect the latest task statuses.
- **Collaborate in Real Time**: Use live **Sprint Notes** for discussing and documenting changes during sprints.

---

**5. Reflect and Improve During Retrospectives**

- **Celebrate Wins**: Highlight achievements and what went well during the sprint.
- **Address Issues Constructively**: Identify areas for improvement and focus on fixing processes, not assigning blame.
- **Define Actionable Steps**: Plan concrete actions for the next sprint based on retrospective insights.

---

**6. Manage Backlogs Proactively**

- **Prioritize Backlogs by Value**: Focus on high-priority tasks that deliver the most value to the project.
- **Avoid Overloading**: Don’t overcommit by adding too many backlogs to a sprint. Use the **Sprint Velocity Chart** to gauge the team’s capacity.

---

**7. Maintain Workflow Stability**

- **Monitor Progress Regularly**: Use the **Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)** to ensure work is progressing smoothly through statuses like To Do, In Progress, and Done.
- **Address Bottlenecks Early**: Plateauing lines in the CFD indicate potential bottlenecks that need immediate attention.

---

**8. Focus on Quality Over Speed**

- **Review and Test Work Thoroughly**: Ensure backlogs meet quality standards before marking them as Done.
- **Document and Share Knowledge**: Use the **Comments** section in backlogs to keep detailed updates and notes.
