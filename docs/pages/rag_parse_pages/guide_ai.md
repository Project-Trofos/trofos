## TROFOS Copilot

<!-- API: POST /api/ai/userGuideQuery -->

TROFOS Copilot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist you with using the TROFOS project management application. It has access to the entire TROFOS user guide, allowing it to provide relevant answers based on the content you’re reading.

**What Can You Ask?**
You can ask TROFOS Copilot about:

- App Features – How to create a sprint, manage tasks, set up standups, etc.

- Agile Best Practices – Guidance on sprint planning, backlog refinement, retrospectives, and more.

**Memory Mode**
TROFOS Copilot includes an **Enable Memory** option (Gear icon in the Copilot header), which allows it to retain your recent messages for better conversation flow. With memory enabled, it can remember the context of your previous questions and provide more connected responses. However, responses may be slightly less accurate compared to single, independent queries.

If you prefer more precise answers, you can disable memory and ask questions individually.

Try asking TROFOS Copilot, located at the bottom right corner, anything related to TROFOS or Agile, and get instant assistance!

## Retrospective Insights

Upon completing a sprint, TROFOS automatically generates Retrospective Insights to help teams reflect on their performance and improve future sprints. These insights are based on sprint data and can be accessed by clicking the **Retrospective** button on a completed sprint in the **Sprint** tab.

**Types of Insights**

TROFOS provides three key categories of retrospective insights:

**1. Backlog Insights**

This insight analyzes how well the sprint backlog was managed. It includes:

- A summary of what was planned versus what was completed.
  Identification of incomplete or rolled-over tasks from previous sprints.

- Analysis of backlog movement to spot rushed or neglected tasks.

- Recommendations for improving backlog planning and task completion in future sprints.

**2. Contribution Insights**

This insight evaluates individual and team contributions throughout the sprint, including:

- A breakdown of completed tasks by assignee.

- Story points completed per team member.

- Notable differences between assigned and completed tasks.

- Suggestions for balancing workload and improving team collaboration.

**3. Agile Ceremonies Insights**

This insight assesses the effectiveness of key Agile ceremonies:

- Sprint Planning – Checks if backlog items were added at the start of the sprint or gradually over time.

- Stand-Ups – Analyzes stand-up notes to ensure effective communication of progress, blockers, and next steps.

- Sprint Retrospective – Reviews previous retrospective content to determine if teams are reflecting and making improvements effectively.
