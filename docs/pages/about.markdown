TROFOS is a web application designed to help educators teach Agile principles and the Scrum framework, while also familiarizing students with project management tools like Jira, commonly used in software development projects. It provides a hands-on platform for students to manage personal or coursework software projects using Scrum, reinforcing Agile practices in a real-world context. TROFOS bridges the gap between industry-standard tools like Jira and the educational environment by offering a tailored platform that combines theoretical learning with practical skills applicable in a work environment.
